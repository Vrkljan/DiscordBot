## Getting Started

To start, run ``npx init-discord-bot`` to generate a project:

```
npx init-discord-bot
```

After you have cloned the project, you need to cd and install the dependencies:
```
cd <project name>
npm install
```
Make sure you as well change the ``.env.example`` to just ``.env`` and populate the varibles inside:
```
BOT_TOKEN = <Your Discord Bot Token>
DISCORD_CLIENT_ID = <Your Discord Client ID>
DISCORD_GUILD_ID = <Your Discord Guild/Server ID you are doing development in>
NODE_ENV = development
```

## Why Use DiscordBot?

DiscordBot provides a template that saves time on doing basic project set up and reduces code where possible. Leveraging file sturcture to organize Commands and Events helps minimize the code and keep file sizes as small as possible as well as maintainable and readable. DiscordBot handles all types of commands and events right out of the box including Slash Commands (Application Commands).
